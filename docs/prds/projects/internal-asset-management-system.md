# Internal Asset & Subscription Management System — Comprehensive Project PRD
*Platform: Internal Tool | Type: Web Application with Mobile Support*

## Executive Summary

### Project Vision
Build a comprehensive internal asset and subscription management system to track company equipment, software licenses, and streamline request/approval workflows while ensuring accounting compliance and operational efficiency.

### Strategic Objectives
- **Eliminate asset tracking blindness**: Replace manual Google Sheets with comprehensive digital inventory
- **Streamline operational workflows**: Enable self-service requests and automated approval processes
- **Ensure accounting compliance**: Provide audit trails and reporting for financial and tax purposes
- **Improve resource allocation**: Enable data-driven budget planning and equipment lifecycle management

### Expected Outcomes
- 100% visibility into company assets and subscriptions
- 75% reduction in manual tracking overhead
- Automated compliance reporting for accounting and audits
- Streamlined equipment request/approval cycles

### Project Scope

**In Scope:**
- Complete equipment inventory management (laptops, phones, displays, dongles, office furniture)
- Software subscription tracking and invoice management
- Multi-role user management (users, team leads, admins)
- Request/approval workflows for new equipment
- Asset transfers and lifecycle management
- QR code scanning for mobile inventory management
- Accounting integration and compliance reporting
- Annual inventory checkup processes

**Out of Scope:**
- Direct integration with vendor APIs (Stripe, procurement systems)
- Automated procurement/ordering systems
- Real-time location tracking of devices
- Advanced asset depreciation calculations

## Background & Context

### Current State Analysis
**Equipment Management Pain Points:**
- Google Forms + Google Sheets system is difficult to maintain and query
- No visibility into who owns which equipment
- Manual serial number tracking prone to errors
- Equipment transfers happen informally without documentation
- No systematic approach to equipment lifecycle management

**Subscription Management Challenges:**
- Company card used by multiple people creates tracking confusion
- Missing invoices at year-end cause accounting issues
- No visibility into who owns which subscriptions
- Mix of company-paid and reimbursed personal subscriptions
- Manual invoice collection from employees

**Operational Inefficiencies:**
- Equipment requests handled through informal channels
- No approval workflows or budget controls
- Annual inventory checks done manually via email
- Lack of reporting for budget planning

### Stakeholder Landscape

**Primary Users:**
- **Regular employees**: Need to view their equipment, report issues, request new items
- **Team leads**: Manage team equipment, approve/reject requests within budget
- **Admin (Mira/Matteo)**: Full system access, equipment allocation, accounting compliance

**Key Stakeholders:**
- **Accounting team (Anita)**: Needs compliance reports, invoice tracking, audit support
- **Management**: Requires budget planning data and approval oversight
- **IT/Operations**: Responsible for equipment procurement and lifecycle management

### Strategic Rationale
Current manual processes don't scale with company growth (targeting 300 people in 3 years). Lack of visibility creates compliance risks and operational inefficiencies. A comprehensive digital system will provide the foundation for scalable operations while ensuring regulatory compliance.
