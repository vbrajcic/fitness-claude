# Smartwatch Integration - Product Requirements Document

*PRD Version: 1.0 | Created: 2025-09-10 | Platform: Cross-Platform (iOS/Android + WatchOS/WearOS)*

## Executive Summary

**Problem Statement**: 24% of user complaints relate to missing smartwatch integration, while smartwatch owners show 2.1x higher workout completion rates and Apple Watch users have 45% premium upgrade rates within 60 days. Our Croatian fitness platform is losing engagement and revenue opportunities by not supporting the wearable devices our most engaged users prefer.

**Proposed Solution**: Comprehensive smartwatch integration starting with basic fitness data sync and workout control, expanding to standalone watch apps that work seamlessly with our existing mobile platform while respecting the Android (65%) vs iOS (35%) user distribution.

**Business Impact**: 
- **Primary Metric**: Premium conversion rate from 45% to 65% for smartwatch users within 60 days
- **Revenue Impact**: €156,000 additional annual revenue (25% of 15k users × €41.6 premium tier increase)
- **Strategic Value**: Eliminate 24% complaint category while positioning as premium Croatian fitness solution

**Target Timeline**: Phase 1 (4 months), Phase 2 (6 months), Phase 3 (8 months)
