# [DRAFT] PRD: Prehrana (Nutrition) Tab - Self-Service Nutrition Content

## Executive Summary

**Feature**: Dedicated "Prehrana" tab in mobile app with self-service access to templated nutrition menus, replacing manual delivery via chat images.

**Strategic Alignment**: Critical to scaling from 15k to 25k+ subscribers while maintaining operational efficiency. Addresses the 28% of chat volume currently consumed by nutrition requests, enabling growth without proportional increase in nutritionist workload.

**Business Impact**:
- Reduce nutrition-related chat volume by 60-70% (from 38 to ~11-15 conversations/day)
- Improve user experience with organized, searchable nutrition content
- Enable nutritionist team to focus on complex consultations vs. routine menu delivery
- Maintain competitive advantage of human expert support while improving efficiency

**Success Metrics**:
- Primary: 65% reduction in routine nutrition chat requests within 90 days
- Secondary: 85%+ user adoption of new nutrition tab (target: similar to current 89% meal plan adoption)
- Tertiary: 30% improvement in nutritionist productivity (conversations/hour)

## Problem Statement & Context

### Current State Pain Points

#### User Experience Issues
- **Inefficient Access**: Users request meal plans via chat, wait for nutritionist response (2.8 min average)
- **Poor Content Organization**: Meal plans received as images in chat, difficult to save, search, or reference
- **Dependency on Chat Timing**: Users limited by nutritionist availability for routine menu access
- **Content Discovery**: No way to browse available nutrition content or find specific dietary needs

#### Operational Inefficiencies
- **High Chat Volume**: 28% of 15,000 monthly chat interactions (4,200 conversations) are nutrition-related
- **Routine vs. Complex**: ~70% of nutrition chats are routine menu requests, not specialized consultations
- **Manual Delivery Process**: Nutritionists manually send templated content as images (inefficient use of expert time)
- **System Performance**: Current meal planning admin tool crashes during busy periods, slowing content creation

#### Scaling Constraints
- **Linear Cost Growth**: Nutrition chat load grows proportionally with user base
- **Expert Capacity**: Nutritionist team (4 experts) becoming bottleneck for routine requests
- **Competitive Risk**: Manual delivery process can't scale to compete with automated nutrition apps

### Business Context & Strategic Importance

**Market Position**: Fitness Anny's competitive advantage is 24/7 Croatian-speaking human experts. However, routine content delivery doesn't require expert interaction and creates scaling inefficiencies.

**User Segment Impact**:
- Primary users (women 35+) value convenience and family-focused nutrition
- High meal plan adoption (89%) indicates strong content market fit
- Cultural nutrition needs (Balkan cuisine integration) are key differentiator

**Growth Implications**: At 25k subscribers, current nutrition chat volume would reach ~7,000 monthly conversations, requiring 50% more nutritionist capacity without operational improvements.
