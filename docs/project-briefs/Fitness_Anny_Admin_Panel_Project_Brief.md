## Current Team Structure & Scale

### Total Team: 80 Active Users
**Critical Understanding**: This is a **much larger operation** than typical SaaS admin panels.

#### Team Distribution:
- **Chat Agents**: 26 users (33% of team) - Limited admin panel access
- **Expert Professionals**: 54 users (67% of team) - Specialized access
  - **Nutritionists**: 15 specialists (largest group)
  - **Psychologists**: 18 specialists (largest group)
  - **Trainers**: 7 specialists
  - **Physical Education Experts**: 4 specialists
  - **Doctors**: 6 medical professionals
  - **Educators**: 3 specialists
  - **Motivators**: 1 specialist
- **Real Admins**: 3 users (4% of team) - **Full control over everything**

#### Access Hierarchy (Critical Architecture):
1. **Tier 1 - Real Admins (3 people)**: Complete system control, order assignment authority, quality oversight
2. **Tier 2 - Chat Agents (26 people)**: Limited access, cannot assign expert orders
3. **Tier 3 - Experts (54 people)**: Only see assigned orders, no queue visibility

## Core System: Expert Consultation Order Management

### How It Works (Critical Business Process)
This is **NOT a typical support chat system** - it's an **order assignment and fulfillment system**.

#### User Experience Flow:
1. **Order Creation**: User selects expert type but **cannot choose specific expert by name**
2. **Order Submission**: Request becomes an "order" in admin panel queue
3. **Manual Assignment**: **3 real admins review and assign** orders to available experts
4. **Expert Fulfillment**: Assigned expert provides consultation
5. **Quality Control**: **All conversations reviewed daily** by real admins

#### Available Expert Types (7 Categories):
- **Nutritionists** (15): Meal planning, dietary advice, cultural food integration
- **Psychologists** (18): Mental health support, stress management, body image
- **Trainers** (7): Workout modifications, form checks, exercise progressions
- **Doctors** (6): Medical consultations, health condition management
- **Physical Education Experts** (4): Movement therapy, exercise science
- **Educators** (3): Health information, lifestyle guidance
- **Motivators** (1): Emotional support, goal setting, accountability

### Anonymity System (Brand Protection)
- **All team members appear as "Fitness Anny"** to users
- Users **never see individual names** or request specific people
- Maintains unified brand identity and professional standards

## Critical Operational Bottlenecks

### 1. Manual Order Assignment Crisis
**Current Process**: 3 real admins manually assign 50-80 expert orders daily

**Bottleneck Impact**:
- Peak hour delays (7-10pm) create user frustration
- Admin cognitive overload during high-volume periods
- Inconsistent assignment criteria
- No automated load balancing across 54 experts
- Complex specialization matching decisions

**Scale Problem**: **3 people managing order distribution for 54 experts**

### 2. Unsustainable Quality Control Review
**Current Process**: Real admins manually review **ALL daily chat conversations**

**Scale Problem**:
- **80 team members** producing hundreds of conversations daily
- 3 admins reviewing work of 80 people = **massive bottleneck**
- Time-intensive manual process
- Inconsistent quality standards
- Delayed feedback to team members

### 3. Team Efficiency Management
**Current Challenge**: Maximize productivity across 80 people while maintaining user satisfaction

**Complexity Factors**:
- 26 agents with varied experience levels
- 54 experts across 7 different specializations
- Uneven workload distribution (Nutritionists and Psychologists handle majority)
- Performance tracking and training coordination
