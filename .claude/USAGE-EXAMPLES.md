## üí° Pro Tips for Maximum Effectiveness

### 1. **Start with Context, Always**
Before using any agent, quickly check:
- Current metrics in project-status-tracker.md
- User feedback themes in research files  
- Strategic priorities in business-goals.md

### 2. **Combine Agents for Complex Tasks**
Example workflow for new feature:
```
feature-brainstorm ‚Üí prd-writer ‚Üí ticket-writer ‚Üí sprint-planner ‚Üí stakeholder-communicator
```

### 3. **Use Frameworks to Guide Agent Usage**
- Weekly-priorities.md tells you WHAT to focus on
- Agents help you execute HOW to do the work
- Project tracker captures WHAT was accomplished

### 4. **Iterate Based on Outcomes**
- If agent suggestions don't fit your context, give more specific prompts
- Update your documentation with new learnings
- Adjust frameworks based on what works in practice

### 5. **Croatian Context Matters**
Always mention relevant context in agent prompts:
- "Croatian working mothers" vs just "users"
- "65% Android user base" vs generic mobile users
- "Family-focused culture" vs individual fitness focus
