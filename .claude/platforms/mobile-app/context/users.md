## Expert Consultation Order System

### How Expert Consultations Work (Critical Mobile App Feature)
**User Experience Flow**:
1. **Order Creation**: User selects expert type (nutritionist, trainer, motivator, educator, psychologist, doctor) but cannot choose specific expert by name
2. **Order Submission**: Request becomes an "order" that goes into admin panel queue
3. **Admin Assignment**: 3 real admins review all incoming orders and assign them to available experts based on:
   - Expert capacity and current workload
   - Specialist availability and schedule
   - Expert expertise match for user's specific needs
   - User's health conditions and consultation history
4. **Expert Assignment**: Once assigned, user receives notification that their consultation is ready
5. **Consultation Delivery**: Expert provides personalized advice via chat, video call, or content creation

**Available Expert Types**:
- **Nutritionist**: Meal planning, dietary advice, cultural food integration
- **Trainer**: Workout modifications, form checks, exercise progressions  
- **Psychologist**: Mental health support, stress management, body image
- **Doctor**: Medical consultations, health condition management, exercise clearance
- **Physiotherapist**: Injury prevention, rehabilitation, movement therapy
- **Motivator**: Emotional support, goal setting, accountability coaching
- **Educator**: Health information, lifestyle guidance, habit formation

**Mobile App UI Implications**:
- Users see expert **categories**, not individual expert profiles
- No "choose your expert" interface - system assigns automatically
- Order status tracking: "Submitted" → "Being Assigned" → "Expert Assigned" → "In Progress" → "Completed"
- Push notifications for order status updates
- History shows which expert was assigned after the fact

**Peak Hour Impact**:
- High order volume (7-9pm) creates admin bottleneck for assignments
- Users experience delays between order submission and expert assignment
- Critical that mobile app manages user expectations during assignment delays
