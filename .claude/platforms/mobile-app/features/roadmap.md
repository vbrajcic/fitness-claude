## Feature Prioritization Framework

### Priority Matrix Criteria:
**High Impact Factors**:
- Affects >50% of user base
- Directly impacts retention or acquisition
- Solves top 3 user pain points
- Enables business scaling

**Low Effort Factors**:
- Leverages existing infrastructure
- Minimal new external dependencies
- Can be A/B tested incrementally
- Clear technical implementation path

### Current Priority Stack:
1. **Performance optimization** (High Impact, Medium Effort) - Blocking growth
2. **Offline capabilities** (High Impact, High Effort) - Diaspora market critical
3. **Apple Watch integration** (Medium Impact, Medium Effort) - Premium positioning
4. **Smart personalization** (High Impact, High Effort) - Retention critical
5. **Social features** (Medium Impact, Low Effort) - Community strength

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
**Risk**: Apple Watch development complexity  
**Mitigation**: Start with MVP, iterative improvement  
**Contingency**: Focus on iPhone HealthKit integration first

**Risk**: Offline sync conflicts  
**Mitigation**: Last-write-wins with conflict resolution UI  
**Contingency**: Online-only mode with better connectivity optimization

### Business Risks:
**Risk**: Performance improvements don't impact retention  
**Mitigation**: Implement detailed analytics before/after  
**Contingency**: Focus on feature additions over optimization

**Risk**: Advanced features fragment user experience  
**Mitigation**: Progressive disclosure, feature flags  
**Contingency**: Separate "Pro" mode for advanced users

## Success Measurement Plan

### Leading Indicators (Monitor Weekly):
- App performance metrics (load time, crash rate)
- Feature adoption rates (new releases)
- User feedback sentiment (app store, chat)
- Development velocity (features shipped vs planned)

### Lagging Indicators (Monitor Monthly):
- Monthly Active Users / Subscriber ratio
- Churn rate by user segment (new vs established)
- Apple App Store rating and review sentiment
- Customer acquisition cost and payback period

### Quarterly Reviews:
- Full user journey analysis
- Competitive feature gap assessment
- Technical debt impact evaluation
- Resource allocation optimization
