## Deprioritized Features

### Features Considered But Rejected

#### Calorie Counting Focus
**Why Rejected**: Croatian cultural research shows focus on calories creates guilt and negative relationships with traditional foods. Users prefer health-focused approach over restriction-based tracking.  
**Alternative**: Emphasis on energy levels, strength, and overall wellness metrics

#### Competitive Leaderboards
**Why Rejected**: Croatian women prefer supportive community over competition. Focus groups showed competitive elements increase anxiety rather than motivation for target demographic.  
**Alternative**: Community challenges focused on consistency and mutual support

#### English-Only Content Expansion
**Why Rejected**: Croatian language and cultural relevance is core competitive advantage. English content would dilute cultural authenticity that drives user loyalty.  
**Alternative**: Enhanced Croatian content with cultural nuances and local expert integration

#### Integration with International Fitness Apps
**Why Rejected**: Users choose Fitness Anny specifically for Croatian cultural focus. Integration with international apps would undermine unique positioning.  
**Alternative**: Selective integration with Croatian-relevant health services and local providers

#### Cryptocurrency/NFT Rewards
**Why Rejected**: Croatian target demographic (35+ working mothers) showed no interest in cryptocurrency rewards during user research. Adds complexity without value.  
**Alternative**: Traditional milestone rewards and achievement recognition
